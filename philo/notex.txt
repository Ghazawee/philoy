- add a separate thread for monitoring
- add a mutex for printing
- create and join threads for philoooooooooos &&
- start with the routine tomorrow(12/01/25) or later tonight

12/01/25 - checklist for tomorrow (13/01/25)
- check if av[5] is less than zero throw an error,
- improve usleep to check every 1 ms if philo is dead
- remove waiter no need it was messing up the code, or use it to check for fork availability, and then do
    the eating sleeping actions if they are available, else think, and keep checking every while for forks
- if a philo is going to eat dont write thinking
- only increment meal_count, and get_time for last_meal after the improved usleep is done
- ask about the thinking printing, cause my code will print thinking then go and pick up forks and start eating
  is it fine or i should i only think if i am not able to eat, but i think its wrong
- also i need to keep checking for forks availability

-"is thinking" log is not getting printed out !!!!!!!!!!!!!

i added two solutions i see which perform better and keep it akram way forks match philo id, or hunger_level
check more scenarios and see if i can remove usleep from uncessary places,
norminette and make sure everything is still working, check valgrind and helgrind make sure no bullshit
then me ready i think

not fixed yet, dies at high philo numbers, try maaz way
